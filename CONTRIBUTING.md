- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. **Test Your Changes**
```sh
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run linting
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...

# Test with real OpenAPI specs
bin/openapi-mcp examples/weather.yaml

# Test database features (if applicable)
make test-with-database
```

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for custom authentication headers

- Add X-Custom-Auth header support in HTTP mode
- Update documentation with examples
- Add tests for new authentication method

Fixes #123"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- Use conventional commits: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description and reference issues when applicable

### 5. **Submit a Pull Request**
- Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
- Open a PR with a clear title and description
- Link related issues using "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
- Respond to review feedback promptly and constructively

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`go fmt ./...`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`go vet ./...`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated for new features
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Changes are focused and atomic (one feature/fix per PR)

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## What This PR Does
Brief description of the changes and why they're needed.

## Changes Made
- [ ] Added/Modified: List specific changes
- [ ] Tests: Describe test coverage
- [ ] Docs: Note documentation updates

## Testing
Describe how you tested the changes:
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing with real OpenAPI specs

## Breaking Changes
List any breaking changes and migration steps (if any).

Fixes #issue_number
```

### Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: CI must pass (build, tests, linting)
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer review required
3. **Testing**: Reviewers may test functionality manually
4. **Documentation**: Ensure docs are clear and complete
5. **Merge**: Squash-merge preferred for clean history

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **`cmd/`**: Executable entry points (main packages)
- **`pkg/`**: Reusable library packages
- **`internal/`**: Private implementation details
- **`examples/`**: Example OpenAPI specifications
- **`docs/`**: Additional documentation and guides

### Package Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each package has one clear purpose
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary external dependencies
- **Interface-Based Design**: Use interfaces for testability and flexibility
- **Error Handling**: Return meaningful errors with context
- **Documentation**: All exported items must have godoc comments

### Code Style Guidelines
- **Follow Go Conventions**: Use `go fmt`, `go vet`, and common Go idioms
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names (avoid abbreviations)
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines when possible)
- **Comments**: Write godoc for all exported items, inline comments for complex logic
- **Testing**: Aim for good test coverage, especially for public APIs

go test ./...

# Specific package
go test ./pkg/openapi2mcp

# Verbose output
go test -v ./...

# With race detection
go test -race ./...

# With coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

### Testing with Real APIs
```sh
# Test with weather API
export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_key"
bin/openapi-mcp examples/weather.yaml

# Test database features
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/test_db"
make seed-database
bin/openapi-mcp --http :8080
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Errors:**
- Run `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies
- Check Go version compatibility (1.22+ required)
- Verify all imports are accessible

**Test Failures:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running (for database tests)
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Run tests in isolation: `go test -count=1 ./pkg/package`

**Import Path Issues:**
- Use `github.com/ubermorgenland/openapi-mcp/pkg/...` for imports
- Don't use relative imports within the project
