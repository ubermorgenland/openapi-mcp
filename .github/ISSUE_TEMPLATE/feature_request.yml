        Describe the pain point or limitation you're experiencing.

        Example: "Add support for OpenAPI 3.1 webhook operations by:
        1. Parsing webhook definitions from the spec
        2. Creating MCP tools that can register webhook endpoints
        3. Handling webhook payload validation and routing"
