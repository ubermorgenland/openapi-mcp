        When using multiple APIs with different authentication requirements:
        
        ```sh
        # Set API keys for specific endpoints
        bin/spec-manager set-token 1 "weather-api-key-123"
        bin/spec-manager set-token 2 "twitter-bearer-token-456" 
        
        # Start server - automatically applies correct auth types
        bin/openapi-mcp --http :8080
        ```
